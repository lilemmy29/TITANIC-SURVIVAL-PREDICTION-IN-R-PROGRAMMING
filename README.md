### Description

This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to predict survival probabilities using logistic regression. It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using variables such as passenger class, gender, age, number of siblings/spouses aboard, and ticket fare.
